The center of the GUI is where the topmost layer's photo will be displayed, if it exists. If operations are
applied to the topmost layer, the changes will be seen in the photo. It is initially empty since the layer
collection is empty.

When the GUI is first opened, it has a group of button at the top that shows all of the 
available features for the view. 
- The blur button will apply the blur filter on the current
layer's photo when pressed.
- The sharpen button will apply the sharpen filter on the current
layer's photo when pressed.
- The grayscale button will apply the grayscale filter on the current
layer's photo when pressed.
- The sepia button will apply the sepia filter on the current
layer's photo when pressed.
- The mosaic button will apply the mosaic filter on the current
layer's photo. When pressed, a box will pop up asking for the number of seeds
for the filter desired, then the filter will be applied if a valid number is given.
- The save button will save the entire collection of files into a folder with a txt
file locating all of the layers. When pressed, the user can choose the name of the
folder saved, as well as its location.
- The open button will ask for the user to choose the folder of layers to choose from
their computer. Once correctly chosen, the folder will be opened in the GUI, the topmost
photo will be shown (if it exists), and a list of all the layers with their names will be 
shown on the right.
- The checkerboard button will prompt the user for the number of rows, columns, two colors, and
and the desired size of the tiles. If all inputs are valid, a checkerboard image with those specificities
will be create for the current layer's photo.
- The export button will export the topmost visible photo from this collection. When pressed, it will ask 
what format the photo should be exported into (jpg, png, ppm).
- The load button will ask for a user to choose a jpg, png, or pmm file. When chosen, that photo will be imported
into the current layer's photo, if it has a valid height and width for the collection.
- The reset button will remove all layers, the topmost visible photo, and will reset the entire model of its data.
- The remove button will prompt the user for the name of the layer to remove. If the name is found, that layer will be
removed from the model and the selection list from the right of the GUI. 
- The create button will prompt the user for the name of the new layer to create. If not in use, a new layer with that name will
be created in the model, and added into the selection list from the right of the GUI.
- The make invisible button will make the current layer's visibility to be false, and will adjust the topmost visible photo
shown in the GUI if necessary.
- The make visible button will make the current layer's visibility to be true and will adjust the topmost visible photo
shown in the GUI if necessary.

There is a button on the very bottom that will execute a
script for the model from a file. When pressed, the user will be able to choose a .txt file, and 
the view will execute it accordingly. 

The GUI has a menu bar with all the option in the top left corner. By clicking any of the items in the menu, 
the user can do the same thing as when clicking its respective button.

As layers are added to the model, they will appear in a selection list at the right side of the GUI. The list shows the name of
each layer in the collection. When one of the layer names are pressed, that specific layer will become the current layer of the model, and
the user will be told accordingly. 

Any errors throughout the process of pressing any buttons will be shown through a box at the center of the GUI.
